* nincs az eseményeket megélő alany
* magunk vagyunk az élmény, a történések, a nyitottság

>Firstly, you need to develop a rested, relaxed mind, free from attachment to thoughts, moods and internal activity. You don’t have to be perfect at it, but the better you are at this, the greater the potential of “entering” into non-duality.

>Secondly, your awareness should be something that has become your best friend. You’re not just aware and mindful, but you’re present(aware) with your awareness and mindfulness. There IS an important difference. Think about it.

>Basic awareness is already dualistic. You, the subject are aware-ing the object. But there is an awareness of THAT dualistic awareness that I just mentioned. Be with THAT consciousness and knowing.

>Be present with the watching that is already going on. Be aware of your aware-ing.

>Eventually awareness seems to merge you and the object of your awareness. It is said that awareness and appearances are one, or that perception and the perceived are one.

>It’s no longer a subject, awareness, and an object. It’s now like one continuity. One experience. The lines are blurred.

>At this point you should try and look at the object, and at the same time look at the awareness of the object, and what do you see? You don’t see anything.

>Let me explain. Can you see awareness? Is it a thing? If it is, what color is it? What shape? What size?

>When you look at awareness itself, you don’t see a thing to see, and now that you’ve already reached a point where you intuitively see awareness and objects of awareness as ONE, then you also realize that the object of your awareness is also a “no-thing,” and thus you are free of the delusion that what you are experiencing, the object, has substantial reality, and your attachment to it or aversion from it breaks.

>You are also free from the delusion that you are a substantial reality, because you’ve become so identified with awareness itself (remember when I said to make it your best friend?), that when you look at awareness and can’t find it, then you see that you can’t find yourself, and that you also are “empty” as they say in Buddhism.

>You see that you and all things are one(non-dual) emptiness, but there’s still perception of sights, sounds, thoughts and so forth going on, but you now know the secret truth about all living things, including yourself. You’re here, but not here. We’re all here, but not here.

>You don’t exist, but you don’t not exist either.

>In this state of realized emptiness, concepts are left behind, so the question of existentialism vs nihilism itself doesn’t matter. It’s also an empty, passing appearance.

>This is the state of non-duality. You let go in this state, because to try and hold on to it is a subject grasping onto a object, grasping onto an experience.

>There’s more to be said. A lot of dialogue and experimenting is needed to make sense of this, but it’s not rocket science. As you practice, it makes more and more sense. Feel free to message me. That goes for anyone.
