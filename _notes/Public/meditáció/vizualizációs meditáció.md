- lassú/lassuló légzés
- emelkedj fel a házak/erdők fölé, majd a felhők fölé, ki a légkörből, a gravitációból, a naprendszerből, a galaxisból
- hagyd el a gondjaidat, teendőidet, embereidet és minden egyebet
- létezz szabadon a csillagok között lebegve
- a végén térj vissza rétegenként a testedbe

### Saját gyakorlat #később felvenni

Hi, welcome to this meditation session. Today, we will use the visualization technique for the goal of relaxing the body and mind.

Find a place where you are not likely to be bothered. Relax, and get comfortable.

After closing your eyes, let's just start with a few big, deep breaths. In through the nose, hold for a few seconds, and out through the mouth. As you're listening to me, you can continue doing this for some time.

Notice how you feel right now. Do you feel rather tired or energized? If any part of your body is stressed, concentrate on it and let go of that feeling.

As we are living our everyday lives, we tend to forget that our mind also needs to rest, not just our body. Let's forget each and every task you have to do. Every person in your life, everything, except yourself.

With your eyes still closed, try to imagine where you are right now. Feel free to fly around the space, the floor, the street or wherever you're at. What do you see? Is everything calm or quiet?

Now, let's fly up to the height of birds. How does your little place look from here? You're far from the sounds now, there's only the wind and the birds left. Imagine that sound.
How does everything look right now? Where is the sun?

Everything that's on your todo list stays where your body is right now. You left them there and they can wait until you go back. Let's move a bit higher, up above the clouds. What is it like to be here?

Lifting up a bit more, escape gravity now. You can see the whole planet now rotating regularly, doing its work just like you at your everyday life. Everything is quiet now. You are alone, only surrounded by space stations and space junk.

Fly a bit farther from the Earth and the solar system, even the galaxy.
Unwind here. Stare at all those beautiful stars, galaxies and planets. They're beautiful, aren't they? You can spend some time here and enjoy the view

Now, you can start going back to your body, step by step. Slowly fly back to the galaxy including all those kmown solar systems. One is yours, start approaching it.

Now, that you can see Earth enter the atmosphere of this huge and beautiful planet. Look at the continent you are on. Just like doing a space jump, you are slowly coming to your place and entering the building from where you have left off. You can see yourself now being in a deeply relaxed state. Approach your body and jump back in. You can open your eyes now. Give yourself a stretch and a few breaths before continuing your day. Thank you for joining me and see you next time.
