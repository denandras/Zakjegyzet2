A body scan is just taking a mental note of how your body’s feeling. So scanning from head to toe seeing if there are any aches or pains or even if there’s any feelings or emotions that are coming up. And the important thing is that we’re just kind of taking note of how we’re feeling. We’re not judging in it anyway and we’re just seeing how we feel at this stage. So if you have identified any painful emotions or physical sensations in the body, now’s the time to take a couple of minutes just to focus on those sensations. Don’t judge them. Just sit with them for a couple of minutes.
